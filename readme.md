3. Open the mission directory by going to `C:/users/<your username>/Documents/Arma 3 - Other Profiles/<your arma 3 name>/mpmissions/<mission name>`
1. Note: If the folder has a file inside called mission.sqm then it is a mission directory.
1. Download or clone `SESO-mission-framework` onto your computer
1. Extract the contents to your mission directory (where `mission.sqm` lives) so that the `mission.sqm` and `init.sqf` are visible in the same folder.
